It’s time for me to create a platform to better present myself as a junior developer. Reasons for this: Profiling myself for a Junior Development Function A good “This is me!” site which I can link to LinkedIn etc. Experience with a project and making up my own approach(making this plan for instance, my previous attempt I was just wining it) I have the time to try out stuff, so this project gives me a chance to reflect on what I have learned since March. Since there are no deadlines etc. I have set myself some goals. The goal is to have a functional site with the basic info up and running at Christmas 2020 with some mandatory conditions:  All original text. No readymade themes All my own HTML, CSS and JS (maybe some fun bootstrap “thingies” just to remind myself how to implement them) All my own solutions (of course I’ll use my books and Udemy/Vijfhart course material)  Site structure: Header: Logo etc. *Landing page / BLOG on the landing page with site updates etc. MENU / WhoAmI / Projects / Projects / Project / Projects / Project context and story / Projects / Files (links, code and pictures) / References (LinkedIn and maybe personal story of one of them) Footer: Social media buttons
